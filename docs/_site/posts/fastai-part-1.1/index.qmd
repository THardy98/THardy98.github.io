This is the first in a series of posts covering my learning/progress from
fast.ai.


**Chapter 1 Questionaire**:


1. Do you need these for deep learning?
   
    - Lots of math T/**F**
    - Lots of data T/**F**
    - Lots of expensive computers T/**F**
    - A PhD T/**F**

2. Name five areas where deep learning is now the best tool in the world.

    - computer vision (i.e. face recognition, object detection)
    - image generation (i.e. colorizing images, increasing image resolution)
    - playing games (i.e. real-time strategy, chess)
    - natural language processing (i.e. classifying/summarizing documents)
    - recommendation systems/search (i.e. web search, product recommendations)
    - forecasting (i.e. logistical or financial)
    - text to speech/speech to text

3. What was the name of the first device that was based on the principle of the
artificial neuron?

    It was called the *Mark 1 Perceptron*. It was created by Frank Rosenblatt, 
who wrote about it in his paper "*The Design of an Intelligent Automaton*". The 
principle it was based on was derived by Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts, who 
determined that a simplified model of a real neuron could be represented using 
*simple addition and thresholding* (i.e. addition and thresholding of *inputs* 
into the neuron to produce an output).

4. Based on the book of the same name, what are the requirements for parallel dis‐
tributed processing (PDP)?

    There are **8** requirements for parallel
distributed processing:
        - a set of *processing units*
        - a *state of activation*
        - an *output function* for each unit
        - a *pattern of connectivity* among units
        - a *propagation rule* for propagating patterns of activities through
          the network of connectivities
        - an *activation rule* for combining the inputs impinging on a unit with
          the current state of that unit to produce an output for the unit
        - a *learning rule* whereby patterns of connectivity are modified by
          experience
        - an *environment* within which the system must operate 

5. What were the two theoretical misunderstandings that held back the field of neu‐
ral networks?


    **After Review**: The first was a misunderstanding of the *capabilities* of
a neural network, due to their initial inability to learn simple mathematical 
functions (like XOR). The second was a misunderstanding that only using 2 layers
in the neural network was sufficient to model any function, but in practice this
was often too slow to be useful (coupled with the significantly weaker hardware
of 30+ years ago).


6. What is a GPU?

    A GPU is a Graphic Processing Unit. A piece of hardware that is very good at
running many, many small computations in parallel.

7. Open a notebook and execute a cell containing: 1+1. What happens?

    It executes and prints 2.

8. Follow through each cell of the stripped version of the notebook for this chapter.
Before executing each cell, guess what will happen.

    Completed!

9. Complete the Jupyter Notebook online appendix.

    Completed!

10. Why is it hard to use a traditional computer program to recognize images in a
photo?

    It's difficult because we would have to explicitly program every step of image
recognization which would be tedious and error-prone. We're also not sure how it 
works or how to program it to begin with.

11. What did Samuel mean by “weight assignment”?

    He meant the coefficients or parameters of the mathematical function (i.e. the
model) that determine the function's (model's) behaviour.

12. What term do we normally use in deep learning for what Samuel called
“weights”?

    We use the term *parameters*.

13. Draw a picture that summarizes Samuel’s view of a machine learning model.

14. Why is it hard to understand why a deep learning model makes a particular
prediction?

15. What is the name of the theorem that shows that a neural network can solve any
mathematical problem to any level of accuracy?

16. What do you need in order to train a model?

17. How could a feedback loop impact the rollout of a predictive policing model?

18. Do we always have to use 224×224-pixel images with the cat recognition model?

19. What is the difference between classification and regression?

20. What is a validation set? What is a test set? Why do we need them?

21. What will fastai do if you don’t provide a validation set?

22. Can we always use a random sample for a validation set? Why or why not?

23. What is overfitting? Provide an example.

24. What is a metric? How does it differ from loss?

25. How can pretrained models help?

26. What is the “head” of a model?

27. What kinds of features do the early layers of a CNN find? How about the later
layers?

28. Are image models useful only for photos?

29. What is an architecture?

30. What is segmentation?

31. What is y_range used for? When do we need it?

32. What are hyperparameters?

33. What’s the best way to avoid failures when using AI in an organization?

Here were my original answers before review:

1. Same

2.
    - computer vision
    - text to speech
    - speech to text
    - natural language processing
    - recommendations systems/search

3. Perceptron (or the Mark 1 or whatever it was).

4. I don't know and don't remember. Maybe something like: operations are able to 
be executed independently, independent results are able to be reassembled into a 
complete result. (This was completely wrong)

5. I don't remember, so not sure. I think something like neural networks wouldn't 
be able to generalize to new data/problems and that they would not be able to 
represent all problems (i.e. only work for specific types of problems/tasks).

6. Same
7. Same
8. Same
9. Same
